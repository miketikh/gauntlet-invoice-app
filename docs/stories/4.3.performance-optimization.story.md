## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context

**Performance Requirements** [Source: PRD NFR1, NFR2]:
- API response times < 200ms for standard CRUD operations
- UI smooth and responsive without lag
- Query optimization for read-heavy operations
- Caching strategy for frequently accessed data

**Database Optimization** [Source: architecture.md]:
- PostgreSQL 15 with proper indexing
- JSONB for line items (efficient storage)
- Query projections for list views
- Pagination for all list queries

**Frontend Optimization** [Source: PRD Technical Assumptions]:
- Next.js built-in optimizations
- Code splitting by route
- Image optimization with Next/Image
- Bundle size < 200KB gzipped

**Caching Strategy** [Source: architecture.md#Tech Stack]:
- Initially: None (YAGNI)
- This story adds caching for read-heavy endpoints
- Spring Cache with Caffeine provider
- Short TTL (1-5 minutes)
- Cache invalidation on writes
