# Story 3.2: Payment Recording Commands

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** to implement payment recording with invoice state updates,
**so that** payments properly affect invoice status and balance.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. RecordPaymentCommand creates payment and updates invoice balance
2. Payment application triggers invoice status change to Paid when balance=0
3. Partial payment support with remaining balance calculation
4. Command validation prevents payment on Draft invoices
5. REST endpoint: POST /api/invoices/{id}/payments
6. Transactional consistency between payment creation and invoice update
7. Domain event: PaymentRecorded with invoice and payment details
8. Idempotency handling to prevent duplicate payment recording

### Testing Requirements

**Testing Strategy** [Source: architecture.md#Tech Stack, PRD Technical Assumptions]:
- Integration tests for command handler (full transaction testing)
- API tests for REST controller (MockMvc)
- Unit tests for domain logic enhancements (Invoice.applyPayment)
- Test transactional rollback on failures

        Invoice invoice = InvoiceTestBuilder.aInvoice()
            .withStatus(InvoiceStatus.SENT)
            .withTotalAmount(new BigDecimal("500.00"))
            .withBalance(new BigDecimal("500.00"))
            .build();

### Technical Constraints

**Dependencies** [Source: architecture.md#Tech Stack]:
- Spring Boot 3.2.x
- Spring Data JPA
- Spring Security for authentication
- Spring Transactions (@Transactional)
- Jakarta Validation for DTO validation
- PostgreSQL 15
- Flyway for migrations (if needed)
- JUnit 5, Mockito, AssertJ for testing
- TestContainers for integration tests

**Transaction Management** [Source: PRD Epic 3 Story 3.2 AC 6]:
- @Transactional on RecordPaymentCommandHandler.handle()
- Isolation level: READ_COMMITTED (Spring default)
- Propagation: REQUIRED (join existing or create new)
- Rollback on: All exceptions (default behavior)
- Transaction scope includes:
  - Payment creation
  - Invoice balance update
  - Invoice status update (if applicable)
  - Event publishing (if transactional)
- Atomic guarantee: Both payment and invoice updated together or neither

**Idempotency** [Source: PRD Epic 3 Story 3.2 AC 8]:
- Optional feature via idempotency key
- Storage: Database table or Redis cache
- Key format: Client-provided string (e.g., UUID or semantic key)
- TTL: 24 hours (configurable)
- Behavior:
  - If key exists and not expired: Return cached response (200 OK)
  - If key doesn't exist: Process command, store response with key
  - If key expired: Process as new request
- Use case: Prevent duplicate payments from retry logic or network issues

**Performance Requirements** [Source: PRD NFR1]:
- Payment recording API response time: <200ms
- Database indexes on payments.invoice_id for fast lookup
- Minimize transaction duration (no external calls within transaction)
- Use optimistic locking to handle concurrent payments
- Profile and optimize slow queries

**Security** [Source: PRD Epic 1 Story 1.2]:
- JWT authentication required for POST /api/invoices/{id}/payments
- Validate user has permission to record payment for invoice
- Audit trail: createdBy field records user who made payment
- Input validation at multiple layers (DTO, domain)
- Prevent SQL injection via parameterized queries (JPA default)

### Coding Standards

**Critical Backend Rules** [Source: architecture.md#Coding Standards]:
- Transaction Boundaries: @Transactional at handler level, not controller
- CQRS Separation: Commands modify state, queries do not (this is a command)
- Domain Logic in Entities: Invoice.applyPayment() encapsulates business rules
- DTO Pattern: Never expose domain entities via API, use DTOs
- Validation Layers: Validate in DTO, domain, and service layers
- Immutable Commands: Use Java records for command DTOs
- Event Publishing: Publish domain events for cross-aggregate communication

**Error Handling Pattern** [Source: architecture.md#Components, PRD Story 4.2]:
- Controller catches exceptions via GlobalExceptionHandler
- Domain exceptions for business rule violations
- Standard error response format: ApiErrorResponse
- Include field-level errors for validation failures
- Log exceptions with context (correlation ID, user, invoice ID)

**Testing Best Practices**:
- Integration tests for command handlers (full stack)
- API tests for controllers (MockMvc)
- Use test data builders for setup (InvoiceTestBuilder, PaymentTestBuilder)
- Test happy path and error scenarios
- Test transactional rollback on failures
- Test concurrent scenarios (race conditions)
- Achieve >90% code coverage on command logic

**Logging Standards** [Source: architecture.md#Components]:
- Use SLF4J Logger
- Log levels:
  - INFO: Successful payment recording, invoice status changes
  - WARN: Business rule violations (payment to draft invoice)
  - ERROR: Unexpected exceptions, transaction failures
- Include correlation ID in logs (MDC)
- Avoid logging sensitive payment details in production

### Relationship with Other Domains

**Payment → Invoice** [Source: architecture.md#Data Models]:
- Payment modifies Invoice aggregate (updates balance and status)
- Cross-aggregate transaction managed by command handler
- Invoice repository injected into payment command handler
- Invoice.applyPayment() method called to update balance
- Invoice.markAsPaid() method called when balance reaches zero

**Payment → Customer** [Source: architecture.md#Data Models]:
- Indirect relationship through Invoice
- Customer not directly modified by payment recording
- Customer name included in PaymentResponseDTO for display

**Event Publishing** [Source: PRD Epic 3 Story 3.2 AC 7]:
- PaymentRecorded event published after successful payment
- Event contains payment and invoice information
- Can be used for:
  - Audit logging
  - Email notifications (future)
  - Analytics and reporting (future)
  - Event sourcing (if implemented)
- Event publishing infrastructure may not exist yet (log event for now)

## Testing
- Integration tests for RecordPaymentCommandHandler
- Test successful payment recording updates invoice balance
- Test full payment marks invoice as Paid
- Test partial payment leaves invoice in Sent status
- Test payment on Draft invoice throws exception
- Test payment exceeding balance throws exception
- Test negative payment amount throws validation exception
- Test future payment date throws validation exception
- Test missing required fields throws validation exception
- Test idempotency prevents duplicate payments
- Test transaction rollback on validation failure
- API tests for PaymentCommandController
- Test POST /api/invoices/{id}/payments returns 201 Created
- Test POST with invalid payload returns 400 Bad Request
- Test POST without authentication returns 401 Unauthorized
- Test POST with invalid invoice ID returns 404 Not Found
- Test error response format matches ApiErrorResponse
- Unit tests for Invoice.applyPayment() and markAsPaid()
- Test invoice balance update logic
- Test invoice status transition logic
- Test validation of payment against invoice state
- Performance tests for payment recording (<200ms)
- Concurrent payment tests (optimistic locking)
- Minimum 90% code coverage on payment command logic

## QA Results

**Review Date**: 2025-11-08
**Reviewed By**: Quinn (QA Agent)
**Status**: ⚠️ **CONCERNS** - Backend validation working correctly, but error propagation issues identified

### Summary
Backend payment recording logic is implemented correctly and validates invoice status properly. However, integration testing revealed that error responses are not properly handled, causing misleading error messages to reach users.

### Findings

#### ✅ **PASS**: Core Business Logic
- ✅ Invoice status validation works correctly (RecordPaymentCommandHandler.java:100-104)
- ✅ `InvoiceNotSentException` thrown for non-Sent invoices with correct status in message
- ✅ Database state is accurate (invoices marked as Sent remain Sent)
- ✅ Transaction rollback works correctly on validation failures
- ✅ Payment amount validation prevents exceeding balance
- ✅ Domain logic in Invoice.canAcceptPayment() returns correct results

#### ⚠️ **CONCERN**: Error Response Handling
- ⚠️ Unhandled exceptions cause redirect to `/error` endpoint instead of returning ProblemDetail
- ⚠️ Error redirect loses authentication context, resulting in 403 instead of proper error
- ⚠️ GlobalExceptionHandler missing catch-all for unexpected exceptions (lines 159-169 commented out)
- ⚠️ Insufficient error logging in RecordPaymentCommandHandler makes debugging difficult

#### ⚠️ **CONCERN**: Missing Exception Handling
- ⚠️ RecordPaymentCommandHandler.handle() doesn't catch unexpected exceptions
- ⚠️ No try-catch around payment processing flow
- ⚠️ Stack traces not logged for production debugging

### Issues Identified

**BUG-2025-001**: Payment recording returns 403 Forbidden with misleading error
- **Severity**: HIGH
- **Root Cause**: Unhandled exception causes Spring error page redirect, loses auth context
- **Impact**: Users cannot record payments and receive confusing error messages
- **Location**: RecordPaymentCommandHandler.java (missing exception handling)
- **Details**: See `/docs/qa/bug-reports/payment-recording-403-error.md`

### Recommendations

#### Immediate (P0)
1. **Add comprehensive exception handling** to RecordPaymentCommandHandler.handle()
   - Wrap entire method in try-catch
   - Log all exceptions with full stack traces
   - Distinguish business exceptions from unexpected errors

2. **Enable catch-all exception handler** in GlobalExceptionHandler
   - Uncomment and improve lines 159-169
   - Ensure all exceptions return JSON ProblemDetail (not HTML error page)
   - Prevent authentication context loss during error handling

#### High Priority (P1)
3. **Add trace logging** throughout payment flow
   - Log before each major operation
   - Include invoice ID, status, balance in all log messages
   - Add correlation IDs for request tracing

4. **Add integration tests** for error scenarios
   - Test that Draft invoice returns 400 (not 403)
   - Test that response is ProblemDetail JSON (not HTML)
   - Verify error message accuracy

### Test Coverage Analysis

**Existing Tests**: ✓ Adequate coverage of happy paths and business validation
- RecordPaymentCommandHandlerTest: 8 tests covering main scenarios
- PaymentCommandControllerTest: 9 API tests

**Missing Tests**: Error response format validation
- ❌ No test verifying 400 vs 403 for Draft invoice
- ❌ No test verifying ProblemDetail JSON structure
- ❌ No test for catch-all exception handler
- ❌ No test verifying no redirect to `/error` occurs

### Code Quality

**Strengths**:
- Clean separation of concerns (Command → Handler → Domain)
- Proper use of transactions
- Good domain validation logic
- Comprehensive JavaDoc

**Weaknesses**:
- Missing exception handling in critical path
- Insufficient error logging for production debugging
- GlobalExceptionHandler incomplete (catch-all commented out)

### Gate Decision

**GATE STATUS**: ⚠️ **CONCERNS** - Requires fixes before production deployment

**Reasoning**:
- Core functionality works correctly
- Data integrity is maintained
- However, error handling issues create poor user experience
- Missing exception handling could hide production issues

**Conditions for PASS**:
1. Implement catch-all exception handler in GlobalExceptionHandler
2. Add comprehensive exception handling to RecordPaymentCommandHandler
3. Add integration tests verifying error response format
4. Verify no `/error` redirects occur during API processing

**Estimated Remediation Time**: 2-3 hours
